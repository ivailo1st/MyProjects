# MyProjects over the years
This is all of my project I have done over the years including the Year 1 last project and my website that serves like a portofolio.
- **E-bike Guardian**: Is a website that is deployed with **Python-Flask** meaning its written in **Python**.
- **30th Anniversary Website**: Is a website that I went with to a Bulgarian competition and reached the national stage. Its written in **HTML**, **CSS** and **PHP**.
- **The Website Две Шепи Вода**: Is another website that I went with to a Bulgarian competition and nearly reached the national stage. Its written in **HTML**,**CSS** and **Javascript**.
- **Mini Project (CarWash)**: Is two **python** files that are used by a **Raspberry Pi 3** for reading and storing car plates. They are entirely written in **Python**.
- **Robo Car Remote Control**: Is again two files, but this time one of them is a php file and the other a python file. They work together so that one reads(python file) what the other posts(php file) in a local file on the **Raspberry Pi 3**.
